            The welcome page got a rework (see below) and i just wanted to tell all of you what this update is all
            about.
            <ul>

                <li>The welcome page has been reworked (see below)</li>

                <li>Some minor design improvements</li>

        <h2>YOUFILTER</h2>
        <div class="description">
            Hey! First of all thank you for installing this add-on!
            <br>
            If you found any bugs or want to request a feature please <a href="mailto:webmaster@tincher.de"><i>write
            me an email</i></a>.
            Also feel free to <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youfilter/"><i>leave a rating</i></a>.
            <br>

            Now on how this works:
            An icon will appear in your address bar when you navigate to youtube.
            If you click it a popup will appear.
            This popup lets you blacklist (or whitelist) a new item and you can edit your items here.
            The <i class="dashboard-link">dashboard</i>, which can also be opened in the popup, provides a more
            convenient
            way of managing your items.
            Here you can:
            <ul>
                <li>Edit an item</li>
                <li>Delete an item</li>
                <li>Search your items</li>
                <li>Change where your data should be saved (more explanation there)</li>
                <li>Export and import your configuration</li>
                <li>Activate and Deactivate the filter</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            The <i class="dashboard-link">dashboard</i> holds some more information on the settings in detail.
            <br>
            Have fun and keep watching!
